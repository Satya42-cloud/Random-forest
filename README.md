# Random-forest
## Random Forest Classification on Glass Dataset

### Objective
The objective of this assignment is to apply the Random Forest classification model to the Glass dataset, perform exploratory data analysis, preprocess the data, and compare the performance with bagging and boosting methods.

### Dataset
- Dataset: Glass dataset, which contains features related to the chemical composition of glass and a classification target for different types of glass.

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
#### Data Exploration:
- Perform EDA to understand the datasetâ€™s structure, including the distribution of features and the target variable.
#### Data Quality Assessment:
- Check for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data to identify and address potential issues.

### 2. Data Visualization
#### Feature Distribution:
- Create visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and pair plots to visualize the distributions and relationships between features.
#### Correlation Analysis:
- Analyze patterns and correlations in the data to understand feature interactions and their impact on the target variable.

### 3. Data Preprocessing
#### Handling Missing Values:
- Identify and handle missing values using appropriate strategies such as imputation or removal, and explain the rationale behind the chosen method.
#### Encoding Categorical Variables:
- Apply encoding techniques like one-hot encoding to convert categorical variables into a numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms.
#### Feature Scaling:
- Implement feature scaling techniques such as standardization or normalization to ensure all features are on a similar scale.
#### Handling Imbalanced Data:
- Address any issues related to imbalanced data using techniques such as resampling or synthetic data generation to improve model performance.

### 4. Random Forest Model Implementation
#### Data Splitting:
- Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to facilitate model training and evaluation.
#### Model Implementation:
- Implement a Random Forest classifier using Python and scikit-learn.
#### Model Training and Evaluation:
- Train the Random Forest model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 5. Bagging and Boosting Methods
#### Apply Bagging and Boosting:
- Implement bagging (e.g., BaggingClassifier) and boosting methods (e.g., AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting) to compare with the Random Forest model.
#### Performance Comparison:
- Compare the results of the Random Forest model with those obtained from bagging and boosting methods to evaluate their relative performance.
